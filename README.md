##Changelog

**5/30/2016 -** Finally got a working, bug-free build :D

**5/28/2016 -** Released Alpha 2.  The game mostly works now, but there are some bugs to still squash and I want to add an undo feature before bringing it to release stage.

**5/25/2016 -** Released Alpha 1.  The game is stable and playable, but there are a couple GUI glitches that make it buggy.

**5/8/2016 -** I created a new project for drag-and-drop in MonoGame since I couldn't find many examples that made any sense to me.  I just released version 1.0 of that code here: [https://github.com/SoundGoddess/MonoGameDragAndDrop](https://github.com/SoundGoddess/MonoGameDragAndDrop).  What I learn from that project will be implemented into this project when I get around to it.

**5/2/2016 -** I finished the animation to get the cards rendering in the right places.  I also added code to move cards from the draw pile to discard pile.  Been stuck on the drag-and-drop code for a while, which is why there haven't been many updates.  Once I figure out how to get drag-and-drop working the way I want it to, I will start working on the actual game logic.

**4/1/2016 -** Microsoft Solitaire Collection decided to stop working for me in Win10 for some reason.  So I thought I'd craft my own Open Source version loosely modeled on the original Microsoft classic.  Nothing to see here yet, as I was just setting up the respository.
